### Using this is your responsibility

# Where can you use this and what is it?
Its common that people use this in school to play games while they are bored during lesson, especially if their schools internet has a method to block website (a proxy)
This is basically a proxy unblocker but only for the games selected -> some games are faulty or dont work on some proxies, commonly 1v1.lol and cookie clicker

# Will I ever create a proxy unblocker for any website existing for school
This is a 80% chance of being a no as I am no where near capable of this but you never know if this will work out.
Another issue is if the teachers can watch your screen then it can lead to consequences
Example: going on p0rnhub (even at home on a chromebook if your school has certain locking and unlocking account times on your school chromebooks) it can still send a notification to your teachers that says you have gone on a certain website thats inappropriate, e.g. impero or that stupid popular one that pisses everyone off (I have forgotten the name)

# What games can you play
There is a wide selection of games for you to play but most popular ones are Minecraft, 1v1.lol, Cookie Clicker and Geometry Dash
There is also a fake virus and fake hacker typing game to play pranks on your friends
Many more are coming soon so dont worry
